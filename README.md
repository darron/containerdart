Container Dart
==============

[docker]: https://www.docker.io/
[dart]: https://www.dartlang.org/

[Docker][docker] is an open-source engine that automates the deployment of applications as portable and self-sufficient containers that will run virtually anywhere.

To dockerize applications means to avoid a lot of configuration efforts for administrators. Applications can be provided in a configured way.

Container Dart shows how this can be accomplished for [Dart][dart] server applications.
